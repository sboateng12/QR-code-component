## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned that sometimes it's not about using a lot of Divs in your HTML. I started using divs which i really struggled to style it before i decided to use Main and Section element which was quiet simplier and straightforward.

### Continued development

I'll have to learn more on CSS and master it very well before I move on to Javascript and other languages.

### Useful resources

- [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
